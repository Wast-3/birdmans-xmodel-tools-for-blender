# PyCoD
A Python library for reading/writing Call of Duty's *_EXPORT and *_bin files.

These modules are provided to make developing plugins for modeling and animation software easy, they provide reading and writing support in easy to use files that do not require any external libraries to operate.


There are currently two available plugins that utilize PyCoD:
- Blender: [Blender-CoD](https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod)
- Autodesk Maya: [CODTools](https://github.com/dtzxporter/CODTools)
