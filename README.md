# Birdman's XModel Tools For Blender
Greetings everyone in the custom cod community. 

This blender addon should finally enable exporting of custom assets from blender to the xmodel format. There used to be another addon for blender that did this, but it suffered from UV mapping bugs and has not been updated to work with the new version of blender. 

Currently the addon only supports static objects with no bones, and does not support multiple materials.
